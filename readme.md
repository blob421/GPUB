GPUB is a program that buys a GPU of your choice on a certain website. It looks 
for inventory based on your search criterias and buys it for you . 
The script runs every 5 minutes (can be modified) . This bot is meant to work fast so you are able
to cope what you want.

Instructions : 

 1. Install the required dependencies. See requirement.txt :
    "pip install -r requirements.txt"
 
 2. Enter your credentials in the provided account.txt and save . 

 3. Login into your account and save a new credit card. You can close
    your browser afterwards.
 
 4. Launch run.bat or buyer.py . The program will ask for 
    the number of pages to scour : I recommend 3-4 . The lower the faster .

 5. When the program asks for a model of graphics card, the spacing is important. Eg: tuf 5070 ti,
    5070 ti super , xfx 6700 xt , TUF 5080 , 6800

 6. You'll be able to see the price of what's found in stock when found and the program is going 
    to buy the first one available. If someone was quicker , it'll try the other ones.
