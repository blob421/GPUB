GPUB is a program that buys a GPU of your choice on a certain website. It looks 
for inventory based on your search criterias and buys it for you . 
The script runs every 5 minutes . 

Instructions : 

0. Install the required dependencies. See requirement.txt :
   "pip install -r requirements.txt"

1. Enter your credentials in the provided account.txt and save . 

2. Login into your account and save a new credit card.

3. Launch run.bat or buyer.py . The program will ask for 
   the number of pages to scour : I recommend 3 . The lower the faster .

4. When the program asks for a model , the spacing is important. Eg: 5070 ti,
   4040 ti super , xfx 6700 xt , tuf 5080 , 6800

5. You'll be able to see the price of what's found in stock and the program is going 
   to buy the first one available. If someone was quicker , it'll try the other ones.
