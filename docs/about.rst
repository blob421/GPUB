About GPUB
============

GPUB: Fast & Automated GPU Purchasing Bot
-------------------------------------------
GPUB is a high-speed Python-based bot designed to automate the purchase of GPUs on Newegg.ca. 
Using Selenium WebDriver, GPUB efficiently scans product listings, checks for
availability, and executes purchases automaticallyâ€”ensuring you secure the GPU you want before
it runs out of stock.

Key Features
--------------
- Automated Inventory Check: Scours product pages to find in-stock GPUs matching user-defined criterias.

- Fast Purchase Execution: Buys the first available GPU as fast as possible.

- Customizable Search: Users define search parameters, including keywords and number of pages to check.

- Optimized Efficiency: Runs every 5 minutes (adjustable) to stay ahead of market fluctuations.

- Headless Browser Mode: Uses Selenium in headless mode for stealthy and rapid interactions.

How It Works
-------------

- 1. Retrieves Search Parameters: GPUB loads user-defined search criteria (GPU model and pages to scan) from parameters.txt.

- 2. Asynchronous Scraping:

      - GPUB launches multiple scraping tasks concurrently using Python's asyncio.

      - Each task fetches a product listing from Newegg, ensuring rapid data collection.

- 3. Efficient Database Storage (aiosqlite)

      - GPUB leverages aiosqlite, an asynchronous SQLite wrapper, to store and update GPU links without blocking execution. 
        This allows simultaneous web scraping while writing to the database, minimizing delays.

- 4. Inventory Checking:

      - Extracts relevant product links using BeautifulSoup.

      - Applies keyword filtering to match user-defined GPU models.

- 5. Rapid Purchase Execution:

      - If a matching GPU is in stock, GPUB immediately starts the checkout process.

      - Ensures fast transaction handling via Selenium WebDriver for automated form completion.














Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).

Configure account credentials in account.txt.

Launch run.bat or buyer.py.

Define search parameters (number of pages & GPU model).

GPUB scans for available GPUs and initiates the fastest possible purchase.

Why Use GPUB?
In today's competitive GPU market, securing high-demand models can be challenging. GPUB automates the process, ensuring you never miss out on a restock and can secure your GPU before others do
